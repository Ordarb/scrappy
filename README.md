## Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti Business Conditions Index (ADSI)
The ADSI is designed to track real business conditions at high observation frequency. Its underlying (seasonally adjusted) economic indicators (weekly initial jobless claims; monthly payroll employment, monthly industrial production, monthly real personal income less transfer payments, monthly real manufacturing and trade sales; and quarterly real GDP) blend high-frequency and low-frequency data.

The ADSI ranges from -3 (indicating a deep recession) to 3 (indicating a strong expansion), with a value of zero representing the long-run average growth rate of the US economy (average value). A positive value of the index indicates that economic conditions are improving, while a negative value indicates that conditions are deteriorating.

## Partisan Conflict Index (PCI)
Tracks the degree of political disagreement among U.S. politicians at the federal level. A high PCI score indicates that there is a high level of polarization between Democrats and Republicans, with little agreement on policy issues. A low PCI score indicates that there is a high level of bipartisan cooperation, with both parties working together to pass legislation.

## ATSIX Inflation Expectation Survey
The Aruoba Term Structure of Inflation Expectations (ATSIX) is a smooth, continuous curve of inflation expectations 
three to 120 months ahead, analogous to a yield curve. A term structure of real interest rates is then 
obtained from the difference between the nominal yield for a particular horizon and ATSIX inflation 
expectations over the same horizon. Note that this method leaves an inflation risk premium inside the 
estimates for the real interest rates.

The ATSIX is created by using a factor model to optimally combine major surveys — the Survey of Professional Forecasters 
published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the Blue Chip Economic Indicators and Blue Chip Financial 
Forecasts published by Wolters Kluwer Law & Business — using a methodology in Aruoba (2016). A forward inflation 
forecast can also be computed from the formulas in the technical note and the latest factor estimates in the spreadsheet. 
The ATSIX is updated around the 20th of the month after the source data are released.

## Chicago Fed National Acitivity Diffusion Index (CFNAI)
The Chicago Fed National Activity Index (CFNAI) is a weighted average of 85 monthly indicators of
national economic activity. The CFNAI provides a single summary measure of a common factor in these
national economic data. As such, historical movements in this Chicago Fed index closely track periods
of economic expansion and contraction, as well as periods of increasing and decreasing inflationary
pressure. The Chicago Fed’s goal in releasing this index monthly is to provide an objective, “real-time”
statistical measure of coincident economic activity derived from a wide range of monthly indicators.
Research studies by economists at Harvard University, Princeton University, and the Federal Reserve
Bank of Chicago have shown that the CFNAI often provides early indications of business cycle turning
points and changes in inflationary pressure.
