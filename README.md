## Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti Business Conditions Index (ADSI)
The ADSI is designed to track real business conditions at high observation frequency. Its underlying (seasonally adjusted) economic indicators (weekly initial jobless claims; monthly payroll employment, monthly industrial production, monthly real personal income less transfer payments, monthly real manufacturing and trade sales; and quarterly real GDP) blend high-frequency and low-frequency data.

The ADSI ranges from -3 (indicating a deep recession) to 3 (indicating a strong expansion), with a value of zero representing the long-run average growth rate of the US economy (average value). A positive value of the index indicates that economic conditions are improving, while a negative value indicates that conditions are deteriorating.

## Partisan Conflict Index (PCI)
Tracks the degree of political disagreement among U.S. politicians at the federal level. A high PCI score indicates that there is a high level of polarization between Democrats and Republicans, with little agreement on policy issues. A low PCI score indicates that there is a high level of bipartisan cooperation, with both parties working together to pass legislation.
