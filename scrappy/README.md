# Indicator Overview

## Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti Business Conditions Index (ADSI)
The ADSI is designed to track real business conditions at high observation frequency. Its underlying (seasonally 
adjusted) economic indicators (weekly initial jobless claims; monthly payroll employment, monthly industrial production, 
monthly real personal income less transfer payments, monthly real manufacturing and trade sales; and quarterly real GDP) 
blend high-frequency and low-frequency data.

The ADSI ranges from -3 (indicating a deep recession) to 3 (indicating a strong expansion), with a value of zero 
representing the long-run average growth rate of the US economy (average value). A positive value of the index indicates 
that economic conditions are improving, while a negative value indicates that conditions are deteriorating.

## Partisan Conflict Index (PCI)
Tracks the degree of political disagreement among U.S. politicians at the federal level. A high PCI score indicates 
that there is a high level of polarization between Democrats and Republicans, with little agreement on policy issues. 
A low PCI score indicates that there is a high level of bipartisan cooperation, with both parties working together to 
pass legislation.

## ATSIX Inflation Expectation Survey
The Aruoba Term Structure of Inflation Expectations (ATSIX) is a smooth, continuous curve of inflation expectations 
three to 120 months ahead, analogous to a yield curve. A term structure of real interest rates is then 
obtained from the difference between the nominal yield for a particular horizon and ATSIX inflation 
expectations over the same horizon. Note that this method leaves an inflation risk premium inside the 
estimates for the real interest rates.

The ATSIX is created by using a factor model to optimally combine major surveys — the Survey of Professional Forecasters 
published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and the Blue Chip Economic Indicators and Blue Chip Financial 
Forecasts published by Wolters Kluwer Law & Business — using a methodology in Aruoba (2016). A forward inflation 
forecast can also be computed from the formulas in the technical note and the latest factor estimates in the spreadsheet. 
The ATSIX is updated around the 20th of the month after the source data are released.

## Chicago Fed National Acitivity Diffusion Index (CFNAI)
The Chicago Fed National Activity Index (CFNAI) is a weighted average of 85 monthly indicators of
national economic activity. The CFNAI provides a single summary measure of a common factor in these
national economic data. As such, historical movements in this Chicago Fed index closely track periods
of economic expansion and contraction, as well as periods of increasing and decreasing inflationary
pressure. The Chicago Fed’s goal in releasing this index monthly is to provide an objective, “real-time”
statistical measure of coincident economic activity derived from a wide range of monthly indicators.
Research studies by economists at Harvard University, Princeton University, and the Federal Reserve
Bank of Chicago have shown that the CFNAI often provides early indications of business cycle turning
points and changes in inflationary pressure.

## Credit Easing
The Cleveland Fed credit easing information show the balance sheet with its components broadly divided into these 
categories, with longer-term securities separated into Treasury securities and federal agency securities, plus the 
base of traditional Federal Reserve assets. You can select different views on the chart to see the assets of the 
balance sheet in a number of ways.

## Credit Easing
The Cleveland Fed Inflation Expectations give information about the expected inflation term structure and the real and
inflation risk premium. Inputs are Blue Chip forecast of CPI, Inflation Swap data, CPI numbers, 1-6mt bills, 1-15y 
treasury yields, and survey of professional forcasters median year-over-year CPI inflation

## Systematic Risk Indicator (SRI)
The Cleveland Fed provides a systemic risk indicator to gauge the level of systemic risk (perceptions of the risk of 
widespread insolvency) in the US financial services following the method inSaldías (2013) and use data on US banks and 
financial intermediaries. Frequency is weekly.
The method of computing the SRI starts with calculating two measures of insolvency risk, one an average of default risk 
across individual banking institutions (average distance-to-default) - ADD - and the other a measure of risk for a 
weighted portfolio of the same institutions (portfolio distance-to-default) -PDD-.  The SRI then compares the 
difference, or spread, between the two. When the insolvency risk of the banking system as a whole rises and converges 
to the average insolvency risk of individual banking institutions—the narrowing of the spread—it reflects market 
perceptions of imminent systematic disruption of the banking system.

## FRBSF Term Premium Model (FRBSF)
The model is a three-factor, affine Gaussian term structure model centered around the affine arbitrage-free class of 
Nelson-Siegel (FRBSF) term structure models derived in Christensen, Diebold, and Rudebusch (2011). The model’s objective 
dynamics are identical to those of the U.S. AFNS model favored by Christensen and Rudebusch (2012).


## NAAIM Exposure Index
The NAAIM Exposure Index represents the average exposure to US Equity markets reported by our members. 
NAAIM member firms who are active money managers are asked each week to provide a number which represents their overall 
equity exposure at the market close on a specific day of the week, currently Wednesdays. Responses can vary widely as 
indicated below. Responses are tallied and averaged to provide the average long (or short) position of all NAAIM 
managers, as a group.

As the name indicates, the NAAIM Exposure Index provides insight into the actual adjustments active risk managers have 
made to client accounts over the past two weeks. Permission for commercial use required.

## Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR Index)
We are pleased to host the Geopolitical Risk Index developed by Dario Caldara and Matteo Iacoviello at the Federal 
Reserve Board.

DThe Caldara and Iacoviello GPR index reflects automated text-search results of the electronic srchives of 10 
newspapers: Chicago Tribune, the Daily Telegraph, Financial Times, The Globe and Mail, The Guardian, the Los Angeles 
Times, The New York Times, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. Caldara and Iacoviello calculate 
the index by counting the number of articles related to adverse geopolitical events in each newspaper for each month 
(as a share of the total number of news articles).

## China Economic Uncertainty Index (CEPU)
We are pleased to host newspaper-based indices of policy uncertainty in China developed by Steven J. Davis, Dingqian 
Liu and Xuguang S. Sheng, based on their working paper, "Economic Policy Uncertainty in China Since 1949: The View 
from Mainland Newspapers." They quantify uncertainty-related concepts from October 1949 onwards using two mainland 
Chinese newspapers: the Renmin Daily and the Guangming Daily.

To construct an Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for China, they first obtain monthly counts of articles that contain 
at least one term in each of three term sets: Economics, Policy, and Uncertainty. Table 1 reports the terms in each set 
using Chinese characters and the corresponding English translations. In a second step, they scale the raw monthly EPU 
counts by the number of total articles for the same newspaper and month.

## Twitter Market Uncertainty Index (TMU Index)
We are pleased to introduce several new Twitter-based Economic Uncertainty (TEU) indices that run from June 2011 to the 
present. It was developed by Thomas Renault (University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne) in conjunction with Scott R. Baker 
(Northwestern), Nicholas Bloom (Stanford) and Steve Davis (University of Chicago).

We first extract all messages (tweets) sent on Twitter in since June 2011 that contain keywords related to Uncertainty 
and keywords related to the Economy.

## Trade Policy Uncertainty (TPU Index)
Trade Policy Uncertainty Index developed by Dario Caldara, Matteo Iacoviello, Patrick Molligo, Andrea Prestipino and 
Andrea Raffo at the Federal Reserve Board.They construct a monthly index of Trade Policy Uncertainty (TPU Index) by 
counting the frequency of joint occurrences of trade policy and uncertainty terms across major newspapers.


## Equity Market Uncertainty Index (EMV Index)
We construct our Index of Equity Market Uncertainty through an analysis of newspaper articles containing terms related 
to equity market uncertainty. For this exercise, we use newspapers from Access World New's NewsBank service. We restrict 
our attention to newspapers in the United States, of which NewsBank covers well over 1000 in recent years. These 
newspapers range from large national papers like USA Today to small local newspapers.


## Proxy Fund Rate

This site presents a monthly series of the proxy funds rate, following Doh and Choi (2016) and Choi, Doh, Foerster, 
and Martinez (2022). This measure uses public and private borrowing rates and spreads to infer the broader stance of 
monetary policy. When the Federal Open Market Committee uses additional tools, such as forward guidance or changes in 
the balance sheet, these policy actions affect financial conditions, which the proxy rate translates into an analogous 
level of the federal funds rate.

This measure uses a set of 12 financial variables, including Treasury rates, mortgage rates, and borrowing spreads to 
assess the broader stance of monetary policy. Using principal components, common movements among the 12 financial 
variables are extracted. The first three principal components are then mapped to levels of the federal funds rate, 
where the mapping reflects the pre-2008 correlations between them. Until December 2008, the mapping is nearly exact 
by construction; after 2008, the mapping from financial conditions to the funds rate diverges. This separation displays 
how the proxy funds rate responds to developments in financial conditions such as forward guidance and balance sheet 
operations. 

The proxy rate can be interpreted as indicating what federal funds rate would typically be associated with prevailing 
financial market conditions if these conditions were driven solely by the funds rate.
